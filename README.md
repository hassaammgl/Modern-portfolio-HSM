🚀 Just launched my new Animated Graphic Designer Portfolio!
Say hello to mgl. — a modern visual journey for Claudia Silvia 💚

🛠️ Built with React.js + GSAP magic
🌀 Featuring smooth scroll animations, creative layouts, and a deep dive into timeline and ScrollTrigger animation mastery.

What I Worked On:
✅ GSAP timelines for smooth component entrance
✅ ScrollTrigger for advanced scroll-based motion
✅ Clean responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
✅ Focus on minimalism, elegance & interaction
